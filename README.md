[OpenFeature](https://openfeature.dev) is an open standard that provides a vendor-agnostic, community-driven API for feature flagging that works with your favorite feature flag management tool.

<!-- x-hide-in-docs-end -->
## üöÄ Quick start

### Requirements

This library targets PHP version 8.0 and newer. As long as you have any compatible version of PHP on your system you should be able to utilize the OpenFeature SDK.

This package also has a `.tool-versions` file for use with PHP version managers like `asdf`.

### Install

```shell
composer require open-feature/sdk
```

### Usage

```php
use OpenFeature\OpenFeatureAPI;
use OpenFeature\Providers\Flagd\FlagdProvider;

function example()
{
    $api = OpenFeatureAPI::getInstance();
    
    // configure a provider
    $api->setProvider($provider);

    // create a client
    $client = $api->getClient();
    
    // get a bool flag value
    $client->getBooleanValue('v2_enabled', false);
}
```

#### Extended Example

```php
use OpenFeature\OpenFeatureClient;

class MyClass 
{
  private OpenFeatureClient $client;

  public function __construct() 
  {
    $this->client = OpenFeatureAPI::getInstance()->getClient('MyClass');
  }

  public function booleanExample(): UI
  {
      // Should we render the redesign? Or the default webpage? 
      if ($this->client->getBooleanValue('redesign_enabled', false)) {
          return render_redesign();
      }
      return render_normal();
  }

  public function stringExample(): Template
  {
      // Get the template to load for the custom new homepage
      $template = $this->client->getStringValue('homepage_template', 'default-homepage.html');

      return render_template($template);
  }

  public function numberExample(): array
  {
      // How many modules should we be fetching?
      $count = $this->client->getIntegerValue('module-fetch-count', 4);

      return fetch_modules($count);
  }

  public function structureExample(): HomepageModule
  {
      $obj = $this->client->getObjectValue('hero-module', $previouslyDefinedDefaultStructure);

      return HomepageModuleBuilder::new()
              ->title($obj->getValue('title'))
              ->body($obj->getValue('description'))
              ->build();
  }
}
```

### Providers

[Providers](https://openfeature.dev/docs/reference/concepts/provider) are an abstraction between a flag management system and the OpenFeature SDK.
Look [here](https://openfeature.dev/ecosystem?instant_search%5BrefinementList%5D%5Btype%5D%5B0%5D=Provider&instant_search%5BrefinementList%5D%5Btechnology%5D%5B0%5D=php) for a complete list of available providers.
If the provider you're looking for hasn't been created yet, see the [develop a provider](#develop-a-provider) section to learn how to build it yourself.

Once you've added a provider as a dependency, it can be registered with OpenFeature like this:

<!-- TODO: code example setting a provider and setting it while awaiting init, if applicable -->

In some situations, it may be beneficial to register multiple providers in the same application.
This is possible using [named clients](#named-clients), which is covered in more detail below.

### Targeting

Sometimes, the value of a flag must consider some dynamic criteria about the application or user, such as the user's location, IP, email address, or the server's location.
In OpenFeature, we refer to this as [targeting](https://openfeature.dev/specification/glossary#targeting).
If the flag management system you're using supports targeting, you can provide the input data using the [evaluation context](https://openfeature.dev/docs/reference/concepts/evaluation-context).

<!-- TODO: code examples using context and different levels -->


### Hooks

[Hooks](https://openfeature.dev/docs/reference/concepts/hooks) allow for custom logic to be added at well-defined points of the flag evaluation life-cycle.
Look [here](https://openfeature.dev/ecosystem/?instant_search%5BrefinementList%5D%5Btype%5D%5B0%5D=Hook&instant_search%5BrefinementList%5D%5Btechnology%5D%5B0%5D=php) for a complete list of available hooks.
If the hook you're looking for hasn't been created yet, see the [develop a hook](#develop-a-hook) section to learn how to build it yourself.

Once you've added a hook as a dependency, it can be registered at the global, client, or flag invocation level.

<!-- TODO: code example of setting hooks at all levels -->

### Logging

Logging customization is not yet available in the PHP SDK.

### Named clients

Named clients are not yet available in the PHP SDK. Progress on this feature can be tracked [here](https://github.com/open-feature/php-sdk/issues/93).

### Eventing

Events are not yet available in the PHP SDK. Progress on this feature can be tracked [here](https://github.com/open-feature/php-sdk/issues/93).

### Shutdown

A shutdown method is not yet available in the PHP SDK. Progress on this feature can be tracked [here](https://github.com/open-feature/php-sdk/issues/93).

## Extending

### Develop a provider

To develop a provider, you need to create a new project and include the OpenFeature SDK as a dependency.
This can be a new repository or included in [the existing contrib repository](https://github.com/open-feature/php-sdk-contrib) available under the OpenFeature organization.
You‚Äôll then need to write the provider by implementing the `FeatureProvider` interface exported by the OpenFeature SDK.

<!-- TODO: code example of provider implementation -->

> Built a new provider? [Let us know](https://github.com/open-feature/openfeature.dev/issues/new?assignees=&labels=provider&projects=&template=document-provider.yaml&title=%5BProvider%5D%3A+) so we can add it to the docs!

### Develop a hook

To develop a hook, you need to create a new project and include the OpenFeature SDK as a dependency.
This can be a new repository or included in [the existing contrib repository](https://github.com/open-feature/php-sdk-contrib) available under the OpenFeature organization.
Implement your own hook by conforming to the `Hook interface`.
To satisfy the interface, all methods (`Before`/`After`/`Finally`/`Error`) need to be defined.
To avoid defining empty functions, make use of the `UnimplementedHook` struct (which already implements all the empty functions).
